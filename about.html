                <h2>What is this?</h2>
                <p>This place is an independent website launched in February 24' by me, myself, and I, Kyle LeBlanc. It's mostly a place for me to share my ideas, experiements, failures, and learnings in a space that accepts more than 240 characters.</p>
                <p>There is no real scope for the content of this space as of current, but I hope that it will organically tailor itself to one specific genre.</p>
                <p>Thanks for looking.</p>
