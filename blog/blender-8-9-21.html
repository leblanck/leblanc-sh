                            </div>

                            <p>I have always favored 3D games over 2D games. I vividly remember pulling all-nighters to play things like TES: Oblivion, Battlefield 2 & 2142, Halo 3, etc. These were all things that helped shape my teenage years. I knew as soon as I wanted to create a game that it would be a 3D game. Seems like there is no better place to start than with learning <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender<span>↗</span></a>.</p>
                            

                            <p>This was a far less daunting experience than what I was prepped for. I have a good amount of experience with the Adobe Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, etc) and Blender is really the same thing (sort-of). Once you learn the tools and different brushes and keyboard shortcuts then things really start to fall into place.</p>


                            <p>Below you can see my very first 3D creations which are all included shapes in Blender, but just using these I was able to learn a lot. Things like adding materials, lighting, adding new objects, different render engines and even just moving around the 3D space was all new but after running through this simple tutorial/class/lesson I greatly increased my confidence in doing basic things in Blender. I should now be able to hopefully white-box my ideas in a more efficient way in Blender or UE4.</p>

                            <p>I was able to accomplish the above and learn a great deal by following this video on YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB3qtedwbSI">Blender 2.9 for Absolute Beginners - Complete Starter Tutorial<span>↗</span></a></p>
