                        <p><span class="highlight">TL/DR;</span> I created a "clone" of my Tabliss extension New Tab/Homepage setup so that I can use it on any browser on any device. I simply set my browser settings for these changes to point to: <a href="https://home.leblanc.sh" class="external-link">home.leblanc.sh</a>. It is very simple, but not all solutions to problems need to be complex.</p>

                        <p>For a long time I had been using the Tabliss extension for Firefox when I was using that as my default browser. I switched back to Safari as my primary browser on macOS which is what I am using 98% of the time. I still use FF when on my Ubuntu box (when not using Min) but I wanted a consistent experience that I could create regardless if I were using Firefox on Ubuntu, Safari on macOS/iOS, or Edge on Windows. (The same theory goes for my bookmarks as well, which is why I recently moved all my bookmarks over to <a href="https://raindrop.io" class="external-link">Raindrop.io</a>)</p>
                        <p>I love the Tabliss extension. It makes customizing your new tab page so easy and clean, if only they supported more browsers! This is not the case however, so that means I wanted to create my own version.</p>
                        <p>The way I saw it I had 2 options:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Develop a new browser extension that is cross-compatible with all the browsers I use. (unlikely)</li>
                            <li>Write a simple HTML/CSS/JS Homepage and host is on a leblanc.sh subdomain that I can point my browsers to. (Ta-Da!)</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>I decided to go with option 2 (obviously). I was able to spin this up in ~2 hours. I started by going to my Tabliss page in Firefox and desiging it how I liked and used this as a design starting point to create my own page.</p>

                        <p>What made this extra easy was to use my existing Netlify setup. I created a new site  project and linked it to my newly created GitHub repo for this project. I also use Netlify to manage my DNS records for the leblanc.sh domain so at this time I alse created a new subdomain for this project.</p>
                        <p>I added all of my web files from my local machine to that GH repo, pushed to main, and boom - home.leblanc.sh was live!</p>

                        <p>All that was left was to change the settings on all of my browsers to point to this new site for their Homepage/New Tab configurations.</p>
                        <p>Hopefully someone can find this helpful in the future. I linked to the repo for this homepage above. This project cost me a total of $0 to setup and make live. It has made my browser experience uniform across platforms.</p>
